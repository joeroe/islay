The goal of the islay package is to provide a high-quality teaching dataset for archaeologists using R.
It includes various datasets relating to the prehistoric archaeology of the Scottish island of Islay (pronounced "EYE-luh") and recorded by the 'Southern Hebrides Mesolithic Project' (Mithen et al. 2000).

## Installation

You can install the development version of islay from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("joeroe/islay")
```

## Usage

The package currently includes one dataset, `islay_sites`:

```r
library(islay)
data(islay_sites)
```
